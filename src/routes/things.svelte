    <h1 class=" font-serif text-xl">What I help people and organizations with</h1>
    
    <p class="font-sans pt-2">
        I work with all the things most small-mid sized businesses needs in the IT-space.
        Web development, back office systems, integrations, data visualizations, cloud infrastructure, plain IT-support and more.
    </p>
    <p class="font-sans pt-2">
        In excess of the things I do behind the keyboard I also do network installations and planning of Wireless networks in challenging environments.
    </p>
    <p class="font-sans pt-2">
        I have been doing these things since 2014 and during these years I have gained quite a lot of experinece.
