			I work with all the things most small-mid sized businesses needs in the IT-space. Web
			development, back office systems, integrations, data visualizations, cloud infrastructure,
			plain IT-support and more.
		</p>
		<p class="font-sans pt-2">
			In excess of the things I do behind the keyboard I also do network installations and planning
			of Wireless networks in challenging environments.
		</p>
		<p class="font-sans pt-2">
			I have been doing these things since 2014 and during these years I have gained quite a lot of
			experience.
